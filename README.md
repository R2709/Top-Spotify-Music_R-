# Top-Spotify-Music_Data_Analysis_with_R
In this project, we examine the popularity of a track using a variety of audio elements from the dataset to see if we can forecast it based on important song-related details. We want to analyze users' listening habits so that Spotify can purchase and recommend related tunes on their platform and enhance user experience. 

To help engineers and the marketing team better segment users, evaluate trends, and try to enhance revenue and improve user experience, this analysis will help to better understand the various clusters and enable Spotify to produce a better targeted content distribution.
